What is Node?
Nodejs is a javascript runtime built on google's open-source v8 engine.

WHY AND WHEN TO USE NODEJS?
-> NODEJS PROS
    - Single-threaded, based on event driven, non-blocking I/O model.
    - Perfect for building fast and scalable data-intensive apps.
    - Javascript across the entire stack: this makes the building process faster and more efficient.
    - Huge library of open source packages available for every one for free.
    - Very active developer community.

-> USE NODEJS
    - API with database behind it (preferably NoSQL)
    - Data streaming (think youtube)
    - Real-time chat application
    - Server side web application

-> DON'T USE NODEJS
    - Applications with heavy server-side processing (CPU-intensive) [Rails, php, python] are great alternatives.

- Synchronous results in blocking code, while asynchronous results in non-blocking code.
- Single thread is where our code is executed.
- Passing callback functions does not automatically make your code asynchronous.

- An http header is basically a piece of information about the response we are sending back.
- An api is basically a service with which you can request some data from.
- Top level code is only ever executed once at the start of the program.

-> What is a Slug?
    A slug is basically the last part of a url that contains a unique string that identifies the resource that a website is displaying.
